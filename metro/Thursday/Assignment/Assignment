Assignment for Thursday October 19.

--

Make some experiments with the simple mix.m script. Does the log
likelihood grow at every iteration? Is the model subject to local
minima problems? Can the model overfit? How can we find a suitable
number of mixture components?

--

Write a new version of the EM algortihm for mixtures of multivariate
Gaussians, with general covariance matrices.

Examine the data in "X":

load X
plot3(X(:,1),X(:,2),X(:,3),'+')

Use your multivariate Gaussian EM algorithm to fit the data in 3
dimensions. How many mixture do you need? Can you visualise the
distribution that your model is finding?
